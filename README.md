# habit-tracker
The Habit Tracker frontend is a clean, user-friendly interface designed for easy habit management. It features a centered layout with a prominent header displaying the app's title and a simple login form where users can enter their email to sign in. Styled with a modern color scheme and the `'Odibee Sans'` font, the design is responsive, adapting smoothly to different screen sizes. The form is interactive, with a sign-in button that, when clicked, redirects users to the main habit tracking page, ensuring a seamless experience from login to habit management.
